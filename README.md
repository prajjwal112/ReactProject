Dependencies
We choose a small number of dependencies but each is carefully selected to deliver a large amount of value to developers. Each added dependency can increase to the overall incidental complexity of working on the application so, for each dependency, we take the time to add a summary and provide links to resources for the benefit of current and future developers.
